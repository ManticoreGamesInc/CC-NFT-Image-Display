## Finding the Component

This component can be found under the **CoreAcademy** account on Community Content.

## Overview

The NFT Image Display component will display a UI image with a loading animation while it fetches the NFT to be displayed. You can add as many of the NFT Images as you like, as the component will auto-set them when fetching a collection.

There is an option to set just 1 specific NFT if needed.

## How to use

The root of the template contains 2 custom properties.

- **ContractAddress**
  This is the collection of NFTs you want to pull from.

- **TokenID**
  If set, then only this NFT image will be displayed from the collection set.

## Learn More

Another idea is to create a slider show of NFTs that the player can cycle through.
